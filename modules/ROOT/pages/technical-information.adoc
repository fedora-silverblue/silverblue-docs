This page provides some background technical information on {variant-name}, including information on the core technologies used to build it, as well as the filesystem layout.

Users should not need to know this information.
It is provided here for those who are interested in the technical details or those who want to use {variant-name} in a non-standard manner.

[[ostree-rpm-ostree]]
== ostree and rpm-ostree

https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/[ostree] is the core technology that is used to compose, deploy and update {variant-name}.
ostree operates in a similar manner to a version control system, but it operates on entire filesystem trees.
It is often described as “Git for operating system binaries”.

For {variant-name} installs, ostree is responsible for deploying and updating the OS image (including everything below `/` that is not symlinked into `/var`).
It also updates `grub.cfg` entries to point to the current image.

https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/[rpm-ostree] builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install RPMs as a “layer” on top of an ostree image.
This makes it possible to install RPMs on {variant-name}.

When a package is installed with `rpm-ostree`, a new OS image is composed by adding the RPM payload to the existing OS image, and creating a new, combined image.
To see the newly installed RPMs, the system needs to be rebooted with the new image.
rpm-ostree also takes care of recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.

[[filesystem-layout]]
== {variant-name} filesystem layout

On {variant-name}, the root filesystem is immutable.
This means that `/`, `/usr` and everything below it is read-only.

`/var` is where all of {variant-name}'s runtime state is stored.
Symlinks are used to make traditional state-carrying directories available in their expected locations.
This includes:

* `/home` → `/var/home`
* `/opt` → `/var/opt`
* `/srv` → `/var/srv`
* `/root` → `/var/roothome`
* `/usr/local` → `/var/usrlocal`
* `/mnt`→ `/var/mnt`
* `/tmp` → `/sysroot/tmp`

This means that separate home partitions should be mounted on `/var/home`.

For a more detailed explanation of {variant-name}'s filesystem layout, refer to the excellent https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/adapting-existing/[libostree documentation].
