= Installing {variant-name}

Fedora {variant-name} can be installed in the same way as Fedora Workstation, and
the official Fedora installation guide can be followed for your Fedora version.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Fedora documentation site]
for more details.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

As with installing any new operating system, it is important to back up any
data that you want to save before starting, and have a clear understanding of
the consequences of what you are doing.

{variant-name} is intended to provide the full range of capabilities that you would
expect from an installation of Fedora Workstation. However, there are some
differences in terms of which applications can be installed, and how the
operating system environment works.

It is therefore recommended that you read this user guide before deciding to
install {variant-name}. It is also recommended that you determine whether
{variant-name} meets the specific needs or requirements that you might have. If you
are uncertain about this, {variant-name} can also be tested in a virtual machine
prior to installation or booted from a flash drive using Fedora Media Writer.

[[known-limitations]]
== Known limitations

*{variant-name} does not provide a fully functional experience for dual booting or
manual partitioning.*

It is possible to make {variant-name} work for both dual boot and manual
partitioning, and some guidance is provided on manual partitioning below.
However, there are hazards involved in both cases, and you should only attempt
to use these features if you have done the necessary research, and are
confident that you can overcome any issues that you might encounter.

[[getting-silverblue]]
== Getting {variant-name}

If you are using Fedora Media Writer, {variant-name} should be listed as a download
option. However, if it isn't, or if you want to download it manually, an
install image can be downloaded from
{website}[the main {variant-name} website].

Once you have got your copy of {variant-name}, it can be installed in the usual
manner. We hope that you love it!

[[manual-partition]]
== Manual Partitioning

As described above, there are known issues with manual partitioning on
{variant-name}, and it should be used with caution. The following notes are
intended as hints for those attempting it, and should not be treated as
recommended practice. Automatic partitioning is recommended.

With {variant-name}, only certain mounts can be manually specified as partitions.
These include:

* `/boot`
* `/var`
* Subdirectories under `/var`, including:
** `/var/home` ({variant-name} has a symlink from `/home` to `/var/home`)
** `/var/log`
** `/var/containers`
* The root filesystem: `/`

The Fedora installer is not aware of these restrictions and will accept custom
partitions without error, even if they are incompatible with {variant-name}.

The above screenshot shows a typical configuration with manual partitioning,
with partitions for `/boot`, `/`, `swap` and `/var/home`.

Manual partitioning on {variant-name} can be done with `Btrfs`,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29[LVM], as well
as standard partitions or an `xfs` filesystem.
