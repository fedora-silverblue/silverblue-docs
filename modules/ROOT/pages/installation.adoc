= Installing {variant-name}

{variant-name} can be installed in the same way as {variant-classic}, and the official Fedora installation guide can be followed for your Fedora version.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Fedora documentation site] for more details.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

As with installing any new operating system, it is important to back up any data that you want to save before starting, and have a clear understanding of the consequences of what you are doing.

{variant-name} is intended to provide the full range of capabilities that you would expect from an installation of {variant-classic}.
However, there are some differences in terms of which applications can be installed, and how the operating system environment works.

It is therefore recommended that you read this user guide before deciding to install {variant-name}.
It is also recommended that you determine whether {variant-name} meets the specific needs or requirements that you might have.
If you are uncertain about this, {variant-name} can also be tested in a virtual machine prior to installation.

[[known-limitations]]
== Known limitations

*{variant-name} does not provide a fully functional experience for dual booting or manual partitioning.*

It is possible to make {variant-name} work for both dual boot and manual partitioning, and some guidance is provided on manual partitioning below.
However, there are hazards involved in both cases, and you should only attempt to use these features if you have done the necessary research, and are confident that you can overcome any issues that you might encounter.

This issue is tracked in https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues/284[issue #284].

[[getting-silverblue]]
== Getting {variant-name}

If you are using Fedora Media Writer, {variant-name} should be listed as a download option.
However, if it isn't, or if you want to download it manually, an install image can be downloaded from {website}[the main {variant-name} website].

Once you have got your copy of {variant-name}, it can be installed in the usual manner.
We hope that you love it!

[[preparing-boot-media]]
== Preparing Boot Media

Fedora images are `Hybrid ISOs` and can be used to create installation media with both optical and USB disks, for booting on both BIOS and UEFI systems.

We recommend using Fedora Media Writer to make a bootable USB media to install {variant-name}. Other USB media creation software may work as well but are not regularly tested.

See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media/#_fedora_media_writer[Fedora Media Writer] section to learn how to use it.


[[manual-partition]]
== Manual Partitioning

As described above, there are known issues with manual partitioning on {variant-name}, and it should be used with caution.
The following notes are intended as hints for those attempting it, and should not be treated as recommended practice.
Automatic partitioning is recommended.

With {variant-name}, only certain mounts can be manually specified as partitions.
These include:

* `/boot/efi` (for the UEFI boot loaders)
* `/boot`
* `/var`
* Subdirectories under `/var`, including:
** `/var/home` ({variant-name} has a symlink from `/home` to `/var/home`)
** `/var/log`
** `/var/containers`
* The root filesystem: `/`

The Fedora installer is not aware of these restrictions and will accept custom partitions without error, even if they are incompatible with {variant-name}.

The above screenshot shows a typical configuration with manual partitioning in UEFI firmware, with partitions for `/boot`, `/boot/efi`, `/`, and `/var/home`.

Manual partitioning on {variant-name} can be done with `Btrfs`, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29[LVM], as well as standard partitions or an `xfs` filesystem.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Btrfs filesystems smaller than 5 GiB should be formatted using `--mixed` (`-M`) flag.
Currently neither `mkfs.btrfs` nor Blivet does this automatically.
See https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mkfs.btrfs.html#mkfs-feature-mixed-bg[Btrfs documentation] for more details.

[[first-run]]
== First Run

On first startup you will be asked to enable third-party repositories, location services, and to create a new user. You can enable third-party repositories and location later, but you must create a new user by entering your desired name and password.

Once you have created the user you can start using {variant-name}.

Depending on different personal needs, there are several starting actions and installations that you could perform on newly installed {variant-name} for a customized user experience.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are new to {variant-name} and before installing software in your newly installed Fedora, you should read the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/getting-started/[Getting Started] section to learn about the difference between *Flatpak*, *Toolbox* and *package layering* (rpm-ostree).
