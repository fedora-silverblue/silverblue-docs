= Silverblue Flatpak Guide
Mike Morrell

== Introduction
This guide is intended for beginner users who are new to using the Fedora Silverblue
desktop operating system and are not familiar with using the Gnome Software
application to install new software on their computer. It assumes no prior
knowledge of Linux operating systems or the Gnome desktop environment and it
provides a detailed step-by-step instruction on how to get new software
installed.

Welcome to Fedora Silverblue. So you have successfully installed Silverblue and
now you want to get all the software you need installed. As you begin, you will
see that Silverblue has a minimum amount of default software available after install.
The Gnome graphical desktop provides the Gnome Software application as the way to install new
software on your system, similar iTunes and Google Play. Start the Gnome Software
application from the Gnome launch panel to begin installing software.

In Silverblue, Flatpaks are the recommended way to add new software applications
to your computer. This is because the Flatpak technology is designed to work well
with graphical desktop environments like Gnome. Flatpak applications provide benefits for
security by isolating application interactions through sandbox technology. They
also work well with the Silverblue ostree technology, because Flatpaks do not
need to update the base operating system files when they are installed. Flatpak
applications provide all the files they need themselves or use other installed
Flatpak platform extensions.

Flatpak applications are provided by remote online repositories that host the
Flatpak files. Silverblue comes pre-configured to use the Fedora provided Flatpak
repository. You can also add additional remote Flatpak repositories to your
configuration, such as the popular https://flathub.org repository. Flathub
provides much more software than what is available in the Fedora repository, so
you will likely want to install the Flathub software repository to get all the
software applications you want.

== Installing Flatpak Applications
=== Gnome Software
Gnome Software is the default graphical software installation application that
Silverblue comes installed with. Gnome Software provides the capability to
install Flatpak applications from online repositories. To see the list of
configured repositories, start up the Gnome Software application, open the
application menu in the upper right corner of the window, and then select
the `Software Repositories` menu item. A window will open with a list of the
installed software repositories. Unfortunately, Gnome Software does not provide
a way to add new repositories from it's graphical interface. To add the
'flathub.org' repository, use the following instructions.

=== Installing Flathub Repository
To setup Flathub you need to open up the web browser (Firefox) and go to the
https://flathub.org/home URL. On the home page click the button for
'Quick Setup'.

The Flathub setup page will show options to select from several operating system
choices. Click on the Fedora logo to start the setup process for Silverblue.

The next page will give you some information on the Fedora quick setup. Click
on the `Flathub repository file` button to start the download of the Flathub
repository installation file.

A popup window will show download option for the file. The "Open with" option
should show Software Install (default). For some reason you cannot choose the
"Do this automatically for files like this from now on" option. Click on the
`OK` button to start the download.

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub
repository install options. This window also shows the source location of the
repository to be installed under the details heading (1). To start the
installation of the Flathub repository, click on the `Install` button (2).

After the repository install process is complete, the window will be updated to
show a `Remove` button in place of the `Install` button. Close the window (1).

Now, if you go back to Gnome Software you should see Flathub listed in the
'Software Repositories' (1).

=== Installing Flatpak Application from Flathub
Now that the Flathub repository is configured you can install some Flatpak software
applications from Flathub. The following example shows how to install the
LibreOffice software application Flatpak from the Flathub repository.

Open the web browser (Firefox) and go to the http://flathub.org/home page. Search
for LibreOffice and click on the link to open the LibreOffice details page. Click
on the `Install` button (1) to start the install or see below about reviewing the
other info on the detail page.

The details below the `Install` button include a link to a setup guide
for LibreOffice that should be reviewed before beginning the install to see if any
pre-installation configuration actions are required. There is also some screen shots
of the application windows to give a preview of what the application interface looks
like. Below the screenshots is a description of the software application.

Further down the page under the "Additional Information" is information about the
last update date for the Flatpak (1), the software version(2), and the license
information (3). Some repositories may not have the latest software version of
the application and some repositories contain non-free software licensed
applications. Review this information to be sure it meets your needs. There is
also a command line instruction to install the Flatpak (4).

After clicking the `Install` button, a download information window will be shown.
Verify the correct Flatpak is being downloaded and then click on the `OK` button
to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak download"]

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the Gnome Software application will open a new
window with an `Install` button (1). This window also shows details again about
the Flatpak application (2). Notice that LibreOffice is Sandboxed. This means it
will have limited interaction with other application and the operating system for
improved security. Also, there is no localization of languages for this application,
so you may need to install additional extensions to provide support for your language.
Finally, there is no documentation provided with the Flatpak. Click on the `Install`
button to begin the installation.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install2.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak Install]

Once the installation begins, the window will show a progress bar and a `Cancel`
button (1). It can take some time for LibreOffice download to complete. While
you are waiting, you can get ready to write a review of the application by clicking
the `Write a Review` button (2). This will open a window where you can get ready
to fill in your review comments after the install is complete and you have tried
out the application.

After the installation is successfully completed, you should see the LibreOffice
application listed in Gnome Software after you reboot Silverblue (yes, this is a bug).

=== Removing Flathub Repository
If you no longer want to use the Flathub repository, you can remove it with the
following instructions.

IMPORTANT: All Flatpak applications that were installed from the Flathub repository
must be uninstalled first or else you will get an error when trying to remove the
Flathub repository (see Removing Flatpak Applications).

Open the Gnome Software application menu and select repositories. You will see
a window open with the list of currently installed repositories. Click on the
Flathub repository list item (1) and it will expand to show the hidden `Remove...`
button (2). Click on the `Remove...` button (2) and then a confirmation window
will open. Click on `Remove` button (1) to complete removing the Flathub repository.
