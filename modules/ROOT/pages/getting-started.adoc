= Getting Started

Silverblue is designed to be easy and straightforward to use, and specialist 
knowledge should generally not be required. However, Silverblue is built 
differently from other operating systems, and there are therefore some things 
that it is useful to know.

Silverblue has different options for installing software, compared with a 
standard Fedora Workstation (or other package-based Linux distributions). These 
include:

* Flatpak apps: this is the primary way that (GUI) apps get installed on Silverblue.
* Toolbox: Used primarily for CLI apps; development, debugging tools etc.
* Package layering: The rpm-ostree tool used for host updates is a full hybrid
  image/package system.  By default the system operates in pure image mode,
  but package layering is useful for things like libvirt, drivers, etc.

For information on <<flatpak>> and <<package-layering,package layering>>, see below.

See the dedicated xref:toolbox.adoc[toolbox] page to get started with it.

[[flatpak]]
== Flatpak

Flatpak is the primary way that apps can be installed on Silverblue. (For 
information, see http://flatpak.org[flatpak.org].) Flatpak works out of the box 
in Fedora Silverblue, and Fedora provides a small (but growing) collection of 
apps that can be installed.

The other main source of Flatpak apps is https://flathub.org/home[Flathub], 
which provides a large repository of Flatpak apps that can be installed.

[[flathub-setup]]
== Setting up Flathub

To setup Flathub on Fedora Silverblue, open the 
https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora/[Flathub setup page for Fedora] and click the 
“Flathub repository file” button to download the Flathub configuration.

A popup window will show a download option for the file. The “Open with” option
should show “Software Install (default)”. Click on the “OK” button to start the 
download.

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub
repository. This window also shows the source location of the repository to be 
installed, under the details heading (1). To start the installation of the 
Flathub repository, click on the “Install” button (2).

After the repository installation process is complete, the window will be 
updated to show a “Remove" button in place of the “Install” button.

=== Installing Flatpak apps from Flathub

Once the Flathub repository has been setup, it can be used to install Flatpak 
apps. This can be done directly from the Software app, or apps can be browsed 
on the https://flathub.org/home[Flathub website].

If you choose to install apps from the Flathub website, clicking "Install" will 
download a file which will be opened by the Software app, which can then be 
used to install the app. For example, to install https://www.libreoffice.org/[LibreOffice], you first 
search for and open the LibreOffice page, and then press the “Install” button 
(2). 

After clicking the “Install” button, a download information window will be 
shown. Verify the correct Flatpak has been downloaded and then click on the 
“OK” button to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the Software application will open a new
window with an “Install” button (2). Click this button to begin installation.

=== Flatpak command line

In addition to using the Software app to install Flatpak apps, it is also 
possible to use the `flatpak` command line interface. See the 
http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/using-flatpak.html[Flatpak documentation] for 
how to do this.

[[package-layering]]
== Package layering

Package layering works by modifying your Silverblue installation. As the name 
implies, it works by extending the packages from which Silverblue is composed. 

Good examples of packages to be layered would be:

* `fish`: An alternative Unix shell
* `sway`: A Wayland tiling compositor
* `libvirt`: The libvirt daemon

Most (but not all) RPM packages provided by Fedora can be installed on Silverblue 
using this method.

Currently, using package layering creates a new "deployment", or bootable filesystem
root.  It does not affect your current root.  This preserves rollback and the transactional model, 
but means that the system must be rebooted after a package has been layered.
If you don't want to reboot your system for switching to the new deployment, you can use an experimental `rpm-ostree ex apply-live` command to update the filesystem to see changes from new deployment, 
but it's generally expected that you use package
layering sparingly, and use `flatpak` and `dnf install` inside a `toolbox` etc.

Package layering is generally done from the command line. However, the 
Software application does rely on it for installing a small number of apps 
that are currently difficult to install as Flatpaks.

=== Installing packages

Packages can be installed on Silverblue using:

 $ rpm-ostree install <package name>

This will download the package and any required dependencies, and recompose 
your Silverblue image with them. `rpm-ostree` uses standard Fedora package 
names, which can be searched using DNF (this is not available on a Silverblue 
host, but can be used in a xref:toolbox.adoc[toolbox]).

Once a package has been installed in this manner, it will be kept up-to-date 
as new versions are released and as the base operating system is updated.

=== Replacing packages

In some scenarios, you may want to test out a new version of `podman` or
`kernel` or other packages that live on the host.  The `rpm-ostree override` command can be used to replace a package with a different version.  You can download the package locally and run:

 $ rpm-ostree override replace <path to package>

Or you can override packages without downloading using links from koji or bodhi. For example:

 $ rpm-ostree override replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/3.1.2/1.fc34/x86_64/podman-3.1.2-1.fc34.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/3.1.2/1.fc34/x86_64/podman-plugins-3.1.2-1.fc34.x86_64.rpm

You may also use `override remove` to effectively "hide" packages; they will still exist in the underlying base layer, but will not appear in the booted root.

Removing and replacing packages using package layering is not generally 
recommended. For more information, see the 
https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/[rpm-ostree documentation].
