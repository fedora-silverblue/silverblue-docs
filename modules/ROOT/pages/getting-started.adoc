= Getting Started

Silverblue is designed to be easy and straightforward to use, and specialist 
knowledge should generally not be required. However, Silverblue is built 
differently from other operating systems, and there are therefore some things 
that it is useful to know.

Silverblue has different options for installing software, compared with a 
standard Fedora Workstation (or other package-based Linux distributions). These 
include:

- Flatpak apps: this is the primary way that apps get installed on Silverblue.
- Containers: which can be installed and used for development purposes.
- Toolbox containers: a special kind of container that are tailored to be used 
as a software development environment.

The other method of installing software on Silverblue is package layering. 
This is different from the other methods, and goes against the general 
principle of immutability. Package layering adds individual packages to the 
Silverblue system, and in so doing modifies the operating system. 

For information on link:flatpak[Flatpak] and link:package-layering[package 
layering], see below. Information on containers can be found on the 
link:toolbox[toolbox page]

[[flatpak]]
== Flatpak

Flatpak is the primary way that apps can be installed on Silverblue. (For 
information, see http://flatpak.org[flatpak.org].) Flatpak works out of the box 
in Fedora Silverblue, and Fedora provides a small (but growing) collection of 
apps that can be installed.

The other main source of Flatpak apps is https://flathub.org/home[Flathub], 
which provides a large repository of Flatpak apps that can be installed.

[[flathub-setup]]
== Setting up Flathub

To setup Flathub on Fedora Silverblue, open the 
https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora/[Flathub setup page for Fedora] and click the 
“Flathub repository file” button to download the Flathub configuration.

A popup window will show a download option for the file. The “Open with” option
should show “Software Install (default)”. Click on the “OK” button to start the 
download.

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub
repository. This window also shows the source location of the repository to be 
installed, under the details heading (1). To start the installation of the 
Flathub repository, click on the “Install” button (2).

After the repository installation process is complete, the window will be 
updated to show a “Remove` button in place of the “Install” button.

=== Installing Flatpak apps from Flathub

Once the Flathub repository has been setup, it can be used to install Flatpak 
apps. This can be done directly from the Software app, or apps can be browsed 
on the https://flathub.org/home[Flathub website].

If you choose to install apps from the Flathub website, clicking install will 
download a file which will be opened by the Software app, which can then be 
used to install the app. For example, to install LibreOffice, you first 
search for and open the LibreOffice page, and then press the “Install” button 
(1). 

After clicking the “Install” button, a download information window will be 
shown. Verify the correct Flatpak is being downloaded and then click on the 
“OK” button to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the Software application will open a new
window with an “Install” button (1). lick this button to begin installation.

=== Flatpak command line

In addition to using the Software app to install Flatpak apps, it is also 
possible to use the `flatpak` command line interface. See the 
http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/using-flatpak.html[Flatpak documentation] for 
how to do this.

[[package-layering]]
== Package layering

Package layering works by modifying your Silverblue installation. As the name 
implies, it works by modifying the packages from which Silverblue is composed. 
Any software package that is provided by Fedora can be installed on Silverblue 
using this method.

A Silverblue installation with packages layered on top loses some of the 
advantages of immutability: with layering in place, the system is no longer 
identical to other installations, and is not as robust.

Nevertheless, package layering can be a useful option for installing 
software that might not be available through other means, or for installing 
software that, for technical reasons, needs to be part of the host operating 
system.

Typically, the system must be rebooted after a package has been layered. This 
is an practical disadvantage compared with installing Flatpaks or containers.

Package layering is generally done from the command line. However, the 
Software application does rely on it for installing a small number of apps 
that are currently difficult to install as Flatpaks.

=== Installing packages

Packages can be installed on Silverblue using:

`$ rpm-ostree install <package name>`

This will download the package and any required dependencies, and recompose 
your Silverblue image with them. `rpm-ostree` uses standard Fedora package 
names, which can be searched using DNF (this is not available on a Silverblue 
host, but can be used in a link:toolbox[toolbox]).

Once a package has been installed in this manner, it will be kept up-to-date 
as new versions are released and as the base operating system is updated.

=== Removing and replacing packages

A package can be removed from a Silverblue installation using:

`$ rpm-ostree override remove <package name>`

The same `rpm-ostree override` command can be used to replace a package with a 
different version. For example:

`$ rpm-ostree override replace <path to package>`

Removing and replacing packages using package layering is not generally 
recommended. For more information, see the 
https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/administrator-handbook/[rpm-ostree documentation].
