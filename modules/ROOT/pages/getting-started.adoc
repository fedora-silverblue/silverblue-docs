= Getting Started

{variant-name} is designed to be easy and straightforward to use, and specialist knowledge should generally not be required.
However, {variant-name} is built differently from other operating systems, and there are therefore some things that it is useful to know.

{variant-name} has different options for installing software, compared with a standard Fedora Workstation (or other package-based Linux distributions).
These include:

* Flatpak apps: this is the primary way that (GUI) apps get installed on {variant-name}.
* Toolbox: Used primarily for CLI apps; development, debugging tools, etc., but also has support for graphical apps.
* Package layering: Most Fedora packages can be installed on the system with the help of package layering.
  By default the system operates in pure image mode, but package layering is useful for things like libvirt, drivers, etc.

For information on <<flatpak>> and <<package-layering,package layering>>, see below.

See the dedicated xref:toolbox.adoc[toolbox] page to get started with it.

[[flatpak]]
== Flatpak

Flatpak is the primary way that apps can be installed on {variant-name} (for more information, see http://flatpak.org[flatpak.org]).
Flatpak works out of the box in {variant-name}, and Fedora provides a small (but growing) collection of apps that can be installed.

The other main source of Flatpak apps is https://flathub.org/home[Flathub], which provides a large repository of Flatpak apps that can be installed.

[[flathub-setup]]
== Setting up Flathub

To setup Flathub on {variant-name}, open the https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora/[Flathub setup page for Fedora] and click the “Flathub repository file” button to download the Flathub configuration.

A popup window will show a download option for the file.
The “Open with” option should show “Software Install (default)”.
Click on the “OK” button to start the download.

After the download is complete, a new window will open showing the Flathub repository.
This window also shows the source location of the repository to be installed, under the details heading (1).
To start the installation of the Flathub repository, click on the “Install” button (2).

image::sfg_flathub_install.png[title="Flathub install window"]

After the repository installation process is complete, the window will be updated to show a “Remove" button in place of the “Install” button.

Alternatively, you can use the following command from the terminal:

 $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

=== Installing Flatpak apps from Flathub

Once the Flathub repository has been setup, it can be used to install Flatpak apps.
This can be done directly from the {update-application} application, or apps can be browsed on the https://flathub.org/home[Flathub website].

If you choose to install apps from the Flathub website, clicking "Install" will download a file which will be opened by the {update-application} application, which can then be used to install the app.
For example, to install https://www.libreoffice.org/[LibreOffice], you first search for and open the LibreOffice page, and then press the “Install” button (2).

After clicking the “Install” button, a download information window will be shown.
Verify the correct Flatpak has been downloaded and then click on the “OK” button to begin installing the LibreOffice application.

image::sfg_libreoffice_install.png[title="LibreOffice Flatpak download"]

Once the Flatpak is downloaded, the {update-application} application will open a new window with an “Install” button (2).
Click this button to begin installation.

Alternatively, each application on flathub.org can be installed through the terminal by running the installation command at the bottom of the page that should look something like this:

 $ flatpak install flathub <package-name>

As an example, Firefox can be installed by running the following command which can be found on Firefox's flathub page:

 $ flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox

=== Flatpak command line

Additional details about the flatpak command line interface can be found in the official http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/using-flatpak.html[Flatpak documentation].

[[package-layering]]
== Package layering

Package layering works by modifying your {variant-name} installation.
As the name implies, it works by extending the packages from which {variant-name} is composed.

Good examples of packages to be layered would be:

* `fish`: An alternative Unix shell
* `sway`: A Wayland tiling compositor
* `libvirt`: The libvirt daemon

Most (but not all) RPM packages provided by Fedora can be installed on {variant-name} using this method.

Currently, using package layering creates a new "deployment", or bootable filesystem root.
It does not affect your current root.
This preserves rollback and the transactional model, but means that the system must be rebooted after a package has been layered or updated.
You can alternatively use `rpm-ostree install --apply-live <pkg>` to also temporarily apply the change directly to your currently booted deployment.
It's generally expected that you use package layering sparingly, and use `flatpak` and `dnf install` inside a `toolbox` etc.

Package layering is generally done from the command line.
However, the Software application does rely on it for installing a small number of apps that are currently difficult to install as Flatpaks.

=== Installing packages

Packages can be installed on {variant-name} using:

 $ rpm-ostree install <package name>

This will download the package and any required dependencies, and recompose your {variant-name} image with them.
`rpm-ostree` uses standard Fedora package names, which can be searched using DNF (this is not available on a {variant-name} host, but can be used in a xref:toolbox.adoc[toolbox]).

Once a package has been installed in this manner, it will be kept up-to-date as new versions are released and as the base operating system is updated.

=== Replacing packages

In some scenarios, you may want to test out a new version of `podman` or `kernel` or other packages that live on the host.
The `rpm-ostree override` command can be used to replace a package with a different version.
You can download the package locally and run:

 $ rpm-ostree override replace <path to package>

Or you can override packages without downloading using links from koji or bodhi.
For example:

 $ rpm-ostree override replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/3.1.2/1.fc34/x86_64/podman-3.1.2-1.fc34.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/3.1.2/1.fc34/x86_64/podman-plugins-3.1.2-1.fc34.x86_64.rpm

You may also use `override remove` to effectively "hide" packages; they will still exist in the underlying base layer, but will not appear in the booted root.

Removing and replacing packages using package layering is not generally recommended.
For more information, see the https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/[rpm-ostree documentation].

=== Adding Additional Repositories

Some software may require adding a third-party repository. This can be achieved by downloading the `.repo` file into `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. 
For example, if you wito install Tailscale, you can do the following:

 $ curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/tailscale.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/tailscale.repo
 $ rpm-ostree install tailscale
