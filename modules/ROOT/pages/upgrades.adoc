= Upgrades and Rollbacks
----------------------

[[upgrading-the-os]]
Upgrading the OS
----------------

To get updates for the OS, you can run: `rpm-ostree upgrade`. Since Fedora 28, gnome-software offers OS updates on Silverblue
systems. Note that due to the atomic nature of the OS, you will have to
reboot into the new image to have the updates take effect.

If you just want to check for available updates, this command will do
so: `rpm-ostree upgrade --check`. Since Fedora 28,
gnome-software also notifies you about OS updates, just like it does
on the traditional workstation.

[[change-to-a-new-os-release]]
Rebasing across new major versions
----------------------------------


There were a substantial number of changes in Silverblue 29; see https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/changes-in-fedora-silverblue-29[this forum thread].  The high level is that the operating system was slimmed down significantly, dropping many applications as well as libvirt and docker.

For desktop applications, it's recommended to use Flatpak; but you may also
layer them back via `rpm-ostree install`.

If for example you want to continue using Docker instead of podman, you can run:

....
$ rpm-ostree install --allow-inactive docker
....

Similarly if you want to continue using libvirt, do the same with `libvirt`.

To upgrade from Fedora Atomic Workstation 28 to Silverblue 29:

....
$ ostree remote gpg-import fedora-workstation -k /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-29-primary
$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora/29/x86_64/silverblue
....

To upgrade from Fedora Silverblue 29 to Silverblue 30:

....
$ sudo ostree remote gpg-import fedora-workstation -k /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-30-primary
$ rpm-ostree rebase fedora-workstation:fedora/30/x86_64/silverblue
....

The process is very similar to a system update: the new OS is downloaded and
installed in the background, and you just boot into it when it is ready.

Just like system updates, rebases can be reversed: the previous
deployment is still available, and you can boot back into it if there
are any problems with the new OS.

We plan to have gnome-software offer the same functionality in Fedora 29
as well.

[[rolling-back-the-os]]
Rolling Back the OS
-------------------

rpm-ostree keeps two deployments around, which both have an entry in the
grub menu. When you boot, you can choose the other entry to boot into
the previous deployment.

To permanently switch back to the previous deployment, use the
`rpm-ostree rollback` command.

[[update-applications]]
Update applications
-------------------

To update your Flatpak applications, you can run: `flatpak update`.
gnome-software will also offer Flatpak application updates. Note that
Flatpaks are independent of the base system, so you can install updates
without a reboot, and just restart affected applications afterwards to
get the new version.

This command will let you check if application updates are available:
`flatpak remote-ls --updates`. If you add the `-d` option, it will
generate detailed information about the available updates:

....
$ flatpak remote-ls --updates -d

gnome-software will also notify you about application updates, just like
it does on the normal workstation.
