= Troubleshooting

Silverblue is a radically new way of deploying and managing your
desktop operating system, so you may occasionally run into problems
while going through your day to day.  Below are some of the more
common problems reported and any workarounds for those problems.

== "Forbidden base package replacements"

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/415[GitHub Issue]

This can happen when a package that is being layered has a
dependency on a package that is in the base OS.  In the
problematic case, the layered package requires a newer version
of the dependent package which is not available in the base OS.

In most cases, waiting for a newer OSTree compose will resolve
this problem.  The dependent package will be updated in the compose
and the package that was going to be layered will be successful.

However, if you continue to encounter this problem with a newer
compose, you can try to cleanup the metadata with `rpm-ostree cleanup -m`
and then retrying the `rpm-ostree install`.

Alternatively, you can try rebasing to any `updates` ref,
like `fedora/30/updates/x86_64` after the `cleanup` operation.

== Installing packages to `/opt` or `/usr/local`

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/233[GitHub Issue]

Installing into `/opt` was commonly raised as a problem when users where
trying to install Google Chrome.  A partial https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/1795[solution] has been implemented
that allows users to layer Google Chrome, however it is not a complete
solution for applications that write mutable data to `/opt`.

== Using Nvidia drivers

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1091[GitHub Issue]

Users have long wanted to use their Nvidia GPUs on their Silverblue systems.
Thankfully, recent changes to the `akmods` and `kmodtools` packages were
made by https://twitter.com/gnomealex[Alex Larsson] to allow for normal
installation of the Nvidia drivers.

 # rpm-ostree install kmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia

You can read more about the work that Alex did on his https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2019/03/06/nvidia-drivers-in-fedora-silverblue/[blog].

== SELinux problems

As users work with Silverblue day-to-day, it is possible that they have modified
the default SELinux policy in an effort to workaround one or more problems related
to SELinux. This is usually done when a user sees a SELinux denial in the journal.
If this is the case and one wishes to revert back to the default SELinux policy,
you can try these set of actions.

. Check the state of the SELinux policy
+
 $ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep policy
 M    selinux/targeted/active/policy.linked
 M    selinux/targeted/active/policy.kern
 M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.31
 A    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30
+
If anything is returned by this command, then your SELinux policy has been modified
from the default.
+
.  Copy the default SELinux policy shipped in the OSTree compose
+
 $ sudo cp -al /etc/selinux{,.bak}
 $ sudo rsync -rlv /usr/etc/selinux/ /etc/selinux/
+
After doing this, the output from `ostree admin config-diff | grep policy` should
no longer indicate the policy is modified.
+
If your policy still appears to be modified, you can try the following approach.
+
.  Remove the SELinux policy; copy in the default policy
+
 $ sudo rm -rf /etc/selinux
 $ sudo cp -aT /usr/etc/selinux /etc/selinux
+
After this, the `ostree admin config-diff | grep policy` command should return
no modifications.

== Unable to add user to group

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/29[GitHub Issue]

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/49[GitHub Issue]

Due to how `rpm-ostree` handles user + group entries, it may not be possible
to use `usermod -a -G` to add a user to a group successfully.  Until the
`rpm-ostree` moves to using `systemd sysusers`, users will have to
populate the `/etc/group` file from the `/usr/lib/group` file before they
can add themselves to the group.  For example, if you wanted to add a user
to the `libvirt` group:

 # grep -E '^libvirt:' /usr/lib/group >> /etc/group
 # usermod -aG libvirt username

NOTE: You will need to log off and log back in to apply these changes.

== `ostree fsck` reports file corruption

It is possible to end up in a situation where one or more files on the disk
have become corrupted or missing.  In this case, `ostree fsck` will report
errors in certain commits.  The https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/345#issuecomment-262263824[workaround]
in this case is to mark the entire OSTree commit as partially retrieved and then re-pull the commit.

== Read-only `/boot/efi` prevents any upgrades

https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1380[GitHub Issue]

This issue is most commonly seen when users have installed Silverblue
on Apple hardware.  The `/boot/efi` partition on Apple hardware is
formatted as HFS+ and is not always resilient to power failures or
other kinds of hard power events.

Since Silverblue now includes the `hfsplus-tools` package in the base
compose, it has become relatively easy for users to workaround this
kind of error.

 # umount /boot/efi
 # fsck.hfsplus /dev/sda1
 # mount -o rw /boot/efi

See the linked issue for additional details.

== Unable to install Silverblue on EFI systems

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575957[Bugzilla Issue]

Users have reported that they cannot install Silverblue on an EFI based
system where they previously had another OS installed.  The error that
is often observed looks like:

 ostree ['admin', '--sysroot=/mnt/sysimage', 'deploy', '--os=fedora-workstation', 'fedora-workstation:fedora/28/x86_64/workstation'] exited with code -6`

A couple of possible workarounds exist:

* During the install process, select "Custom Partitioning" and create an additional EFI partition. Assign the newly created EFI partition to `/boot/efi`. You will then be able to boot the previous OS(s) alongside Fedora Silverblue. If this workaround is not successful follow the below step.
* Reformat the EFI partition on the host during the install process. This can be done by selecting "Custom Partitioning" and checking the `Reformat` box when creating the `/boot/efi` partition.

WARNING: Choosing to reformat `/boot/efi` will likely result in the inability
to boot any other operating systems that were previously installed. Be sure that
you have backed up any important data before using this workaround.

== `toolbox: failed to list images with com.redhat.component=fedora-toolbox`

IMPORTANT: As of `podman` version `1.4.0` this workaround is not necessary. Ensure `podman` is up to date by issuing `rpm-ostree upgrade` before attempting this workaround.

When issuing the `toolbox list` command, systems using `podman` versions newer than `1.2.0`, will generate the following error:

 toolbox: failed to list images with com.redhat.component=fedora-toolbox

TIP: The following workaround might be useful for other `toolbox` errors caused by `podman` versions greater than `1.2.0`. See https://github.com/debarshiray/toolbox/issues/169#issuecomment-495193902[Toolbox Github Repo]

As a workaround, it is possible to override `podman` packages newer than version `1.2.0` by issuing:

 $ rpm-ostree override --remove=podman-manpages replace https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/1.2.0/2.git3bd528e.fc30/x86_64/podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm

Reboot the system to apply the changes.

For reference, it is also possible to override the package by following these steps: 

. Download `podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm` from https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/podman/1.2.0/2.git3bd528e.fc30/x86_64/podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm[Koji]
. Remove `podman-manpages` issuing: `rpm-ostree override remove podman-manpages`
. Override the currently installed `podman` package (using the package you have downloaded on the first step) by: `rpm-ostree override replace podman-1.2.0-2.git3bd528e.fc30.x86_64.rpm`

You can now reboot the system for the change to take effect.

To revert this workaround issue the following command:

 $ rpm-ostree override reset podman; rpm-ostree override reset podman-manpages

== Unable to enter a toolbox due to permissions errors

https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3187[GitHub Issue]

With certain versions of `podman`, trying to enter a toolbox will result in
errors. You can fix this by resetting the permissions on the overlay-containers
with the following command.

 $ sudo chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/containers/storage/overlay-containers

This will reset the permissions on your containers and allow you to enter them again.

== Running `restorecon`

WARNING: You should never run `restorecon` on a Silverblue host.  See the following
bug for details - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1259018

However, if you happened to do this, it is possible to recover.

1.  Boot with `enforcing=0` on the kernel command line
2.  Create a new, "fixed" commit locally
3.  Deploy the new "fixed" commit
4.  Run `restorecon`
5.  Reboot
6.  Cleanup

 $ rpm-ostree status -b | grep BaseCommit
                 BaseCommit: 696991d589980aeaef5eda352dd7ad3d33c444c789c209f793a84bc6e7269aee
 $ sudo ostree checkout -H 696991d589980aeaef5eda352dd7ad3d33c444c789c209f793a84bc6e7269aee /ostree/repo/tmp/selinux-fix
 $ sudo ostree fsck --delete
 $ sudo ostree commit --consume --link-checkout-speedup --orphan --selinux-policy=/ /ostree/repo/tmp/selinux-fix
 $ sudo restorecon -Rv /var
 $ sudo restorecon -Rv /etc
 $ sudo ostree admin deploy fedora-atomic:fedora/30/x86_64/silverblue
 $ sudo reboot

The caveat to this recovery is that your layered packages will be removed; you'll
need to relayer them after the recovery.
