== About the project

[qanda]
Is it Team Silverblue, Silverblue, or Fedora Silverblue?::
    We chose the name Team Silverblue to refer to the overall project. Fedora 
    Silverblue will be used for the OS that we are producing, but calling it 
    Silverblue in its short version is fine as well.

Why does the Silverblue logo look like a leaf?::
    Our favorite choice for a project name was Silverleaf, but that sadly did 
    not work out. We just couldn't quite let go of the leaf. You could also say 
    that Silverblue is a new new leaf on Fedora's OSTree. ðŸ˜€

Is Silverbue another GNOME OS?::
    GNOME OS was a codename that was used by the upstream GNOME project for a 
    while to refer to the idea of designing the entire deskotp user experience. 
    By contrast, Silverblue is an effort inside the Fedora project, and will be 
    built with existing Fedora technologies. However, the two efforts do share 
    a desire to deliver a user experience that is polished and coherent.

What is Silverblue's relationship with Project Atomic?::
    Fedora Silverblue uses the same core technology as Fedora Atomic Host (as 
    well as its successor, Fedora CoreOS). However, Silverblue is specifically 
    focused on workstation/desktop use cases.

How can I install Eclipse on Silverblue?::
    Instructions to setup the Nightly flatpak remote for Eclipse are available
    http://eclipse.matbooth.co.uk/flatpak[here].

How do I create a VPN connection?::
    `/etc` is not part of the immutable OS image, so you can just copy files 
    into `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` (or let NetworkManager store 
    them there when you recreate your connections). Certificates in `/etc/pki` 
    need to be handled similarly.

How can I play more videos in Firefox, like YouTube?::
    Firefox is included in the OS image for now. Until that changes, getting it 
    to play videos works the same way as it does for the regular Fedora 
    Workstation: find a package with the needed codecs, and install it. The one 
    difference is that you use `rpm-ostree install` instead of dnf `install.`
    An alternative solution is to install the nightly Firefox, which is 
    available as a 
    https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly.flatpakref[Flatpak].
