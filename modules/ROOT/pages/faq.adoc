== About the project

[qanda]
Is it Team Silverblue, Silverblue, or Fedora Silverblue?::
    We chose the name Team Silverblue to refer to the overall project. Fedora 
    Silverblue will be used for the OS that we are producing, but calling it 
    Silverblue in its short version is fine as well.

Why does the Silverblue logo look like a leaf?::
    Our favorite choice for a project name was Silverleaf, but that sadly did 
    not work out. We just couldn't quite let go of the leaf. You could also say 
    that Silverblue is a new leaf on Fedora's OSTree. ðŸ˜€

Is Silverblue another GNOME OS?::
    GNOME OS was a codename that was used by the upstream GNOME project for a 
    while to refer to the idea of designing the entire desktop user experience. 
    By contrast, Silverblue is an effort inside the Fedora project, and will be 
    built with existing Fedora technologies. However, the two efforts do share 
    a desire to deliver a user experience that is polished and coherent.

What is Silverblue's relationship with Project Atomic?::
    Fedora Silverblue uses the same core technology as Fedora Atomic Host (as 
    well as its successor, Fedora CoreOS). However, Silverblue is specifically 
    focused on workstation/desktop use cases.

== About using Silverblue

How can I install Eclipse on Silverblue?::
    Instructions to setup the Nightly flatpak remote for Eclipse are available
    http://eclipse.matbooth.co.uk/flatpak[here].

How do I create a VPN connection?::
    `/etc` is not part of the immutable OS image, so you can just copy files 
    into `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` (or let NetworkManager store 
    them there when you recreate your connections). Certificates in `/etc/pki` 
    need to be handled similarly.

How can I play more videos in Firefox, like YouTube?::
    Firefox is included in the OS image for now. Until that changes, getting it 
    to play videos works the same way as it does for the regular Fedora 
    Workstation: find a package with the needed codecs, and install it. The one 
    difference is that you use `rpm-ostree install` instead of `dnf install`.
    An alternative solution is to install the nightly Firefox, which is 
    available as a 
    https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly.flatpakref[Flatpak].

How can I see what packages were updated between two commits?::

* If you want to compare the booted deployment with the pending deployment (or rollback deployment), simply issue:

 $ rpm-ostree db diff
+
TIP: You can also see the RPM changelog by adding the `-c` option like so: `rpm-ostree db diff -c`

* If you want to see which packages were updated between two specific commits:

. find out which two commits you want to compare by issuing:
 
 $ ostree log <ref>

. you can now compare the two commits by issuing:

 $ rpm-ostree db diff <commit x> <commit y>

How can I check the version number of an installed package?::

You can simply use:

 $ rpm -q <package>

How can I check if an `rpm` software package is available in the repository?::

At this point in time, there is no `rpm` package search function built into `rpm-ostree`. However, you can use `toolbox` with the following command:

 $ toolbox run dnf search <package>
+
NOTE: The assumption is that you have already created a toolbox matching the version of your Fedora Silverblue installation.

How can I downgrade my system's kernel?::

If, for whatever reason, you need to downgrade the kernel, you can do so by following these steps:

. For the version you need to downgrade, download `<kernel>`, `<kernel-core>`, `<kernel-modules>` and `<kernel-modules-extra>` from https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8[Koji].

. Install the packages downloaded on the previous step by issuing:

 $ rpm-ostree override replace <kernel> <kernel-core> <kernel-modules> <kernel-modules-extra>

. Reboot the system to apply the changes.

How can I upgrade my system to the next major version (for instance: rawhide or an upcoming Fedora release branch), while keeping my current deployment?::

OSTree allows you to pin deployments (pinning ensures that your deployment of choice is kept and not discarded).

. Assuming that you want to keep your default deployment, issue the following command:

 $ sudo ostree admin pin 0
+
NOTE: `0` here refers to the first deployment listed by `rpm-ostree status`

. Verify that you have pinned your deployment of choice by issuing:

 rpm-ostree status

. After the deployment is pinned, you can upgrade your system by using the instructions found https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/updates-upgrades-rollbacks/#upgrading[here.]

. When you have completed rebasing, reboot the system. The GRUB menu will now present you with both: the previous deployment major version entry (e.g.: *"Fedora 30.YYYYMMDD.n"*) and the new deployment major version entry (e.g.: *"Fedora 31.YYYYMMDD.n"*).
+
NOTE: At the moment it is not possible to name (pinned) deployments and their associated GRUB menu entries.
