Filesystem Layout
-----------------

The root filesystem has the immutable attribute set on OSTree
installations, so `/`, `/usr` and everything below it is readonly. `/var` is
where all the runtime state is kept. There are some symlinks that put
the state-carrying directories in their traditional, expected place:

* `/home` → `/var/home`
* `/opt` → `/var/opt`
* `/srv` → `/var/srv`
* `/root` → `/var/roothome`
* `/usr/local` → `/var/usrlocal`
* `/mnt`→ `/var/mnt`
* `/tmp` → `/sysroot/tmp`

and so on. If you have a separate home partition on your system, it
should be mounted on `/var/home`.

For a more detailed explanation of the system layout, refer to the 
excellent https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/adapting-existing/[libostree documentation] 
on this subject.

Packaging: ostree, rpms, flatpaks and containers
------------------------------------------------

_ostree_ is responsible for deploying and updating the OS image (ie
everything below `/` that is not symlinked into `/var`). ostree also
contains the necessary logic to update grub.cfg entries to point to the
current image.

_rpm-ostree_ builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install
rpms as a 'layer' on top of an ostree image. In practice, that means you
can install rpms as usual, just use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf
install. What happens under the covers is that rpm-ostree will compose a
new OS image by adding the rpm payload to the existing OS image, and
creating a new, combined image. To see the newly installed rpms, you
have to reboot into the new image. _rpm-ostree_ also takes care of
recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.

_flatpak_ uses container technologies to deploy and run desktop
applications isolated from the underlying OS.

You can of course use other container tools like _podman_ or _buildah_
to run other containers on a Silverblue system.

[[using-flatpak]]
Using Flatpak
-------------

If you don't want to use the _flatpak_ commandline tools, GNOME Software
has excellent support for installing Flatpaks. There are several
repositories that provide Flatpaks.

* http://flathub.org[Flathub] is a convenient place to find many popular
desktop apps
* http://registry.fedoraproject.org[Fedora registry] hosts Flatpaks in OCI format, built from rpms
* https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome-apps-nightly.flatpakrepo[GNOME nightly]
provides builds of unstable GNOME apps
* https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly.flatpakref[Firefox
nightly]
* http://eclipse.matbooth.co.uk/[Eclipse nightly]

Once you have repositories enabled, you can use GNOME Software's
excellent support for searching Flatpaks. Or you can use `flatpak 
search` command.

[[using-pkg-layering]]
Using Package Layering
----------------------

Package layering works by re-composing the OS image locally, while
adding extra rpm packages to it. This is done with the `rpm-ostree
install` command. Once a package has been layered, rpm-ostree will keep
it up-to-date for you and recreate the layer when you install a newer OS
image.

You can also remove a package from OS image. The command to do this is 
`rpm-ostree override remove`.

rpm-ostree does not currently have an equivalent to the `dnf search`
command for finding packages in the configured repositories. As a
workaround, you can run _dnf_ in a temporary container like this:

----
$ sudo podman run --rm fedora:28 dnf search <1>
----
<1> provide your search term

[[third-party-repos]]
Enabling third-party RPM Repositories
-------------------------------------

Silverblue installs a number of yum repositories containing useful
software that is not part of Fedora proper for various reasons. You can
enable these repositories either during the initial setup of an new
install, or from the "Software Repositories" dialog in GNOME Software.
