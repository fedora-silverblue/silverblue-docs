= Toolbox

As an immutable host, Silverblue is an excellent platform for container-based 
development and, for working with containers, https://buildah.io/[buildah] and 
https://podman.io/[podman] are recommended.

Silverblue also comes with the _toolbox_ utility, which uses containers to 
provide an environment where development tools and libraries can be installed 
and used. The link:toolbox[toolbox page] provides more details on this.

Toolbox makes it easy to use a containerized environment for everyday software 
development and debugging. On immutable operating systems, like
https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Silverblue], it  provides a 
familiar package-based environment in which tools and libraries can be 
installed and used. However, toolbox can also be used on package-based systems.

[[toolbox-why-use]]
== Why use toolbox?

Using toolbox containers to install development tools offers a number of 
advantages:

- It keeps the host OS clean and stable, and helps to avoid the clutter that 
can happen after installing lots of development tools and packages.
- Containers are a safe space to experiment: if things go wrong, it's easy to 
throw a toolbox away and start again. 
- Containers are a good way to isolate and organise the dependencies needed for 
different projects.

[[toolbox-how-it-works]]
== How it works

Toolbox takes the work out of using containers, by providing a small number of 
simple commands to  create, enter, list and remove containers. It also 
integrates toolbox containers into your regular working environment, to 
make it easy for you to use them as an everyday development space.

Each toolbox container is an environment that you can enter from the command 
line. Inside each one, you will find:

- Your existing username and permissions
- Access to your home directory
- Common command lines tools, including the DNF package manager

In other words, toolbox containers look, feel and behave like a standard Linux 
command line environment.

In most cases, when a command is run inside a container, the program from 
inside the container is used. However, there are a few special cases where the 
program on the host is used instead. One example of this is the toolbox command 
itself; this makes it possible to use toolbox from inside toolbox containers.

[[toolbox-installation]]
== Installation

=== Fedora Silverblue

Toolbox is preinstalled on Fedora Silverblue 30 or newer. On older versions, it 
can be installed with the following command:

`$ rpm-ostree install toolbox`

This will install toolbox as a layered RPM.

=== Fedora Workstation

Toolbox can be installed on Fedora Workstation (or any package-based version of 
Fedora) with the following command:

`$ dnf install toolbox`

[[toolbox-first-toolbox]]
## Your first toolbox

Once toolbox is installed, two simple commands are required to get started:

`$ toolbox create`

This will download an OCI image and create a toolbox container from it. Once 
this is complete, run:

`$ toolbox enter`

Once inside the toolbox, you can access common command line tools, and install 
new ones using DNF. 

[NOTE]
When the prompt is inside a toolbox, it is prepended with a diamond: 
this indicates that the prompt is inside a toolbox container.

[[toolbox-commands]]
== Commands and usage

`toolbox create [--container <name>]`::

Creates a toolbox container. This will download an OCI image if one isn't 
available (this is required to create the container). By default a Fedora image 
matching the version of the host is used. Used without options, 
`toolbox create` will automatically name the container it creates. To create 
additional toolboxes, use the  ``--container <name>`` option.
  
`toolbox enter [--container <name>]`::

Enters a toolbox for interactive use. Used without options, `toolbox enter` 
opens the default toolbox. If there is more than one toolbox, use the 
`--container name` option to specify the toolbox to enter.

`toolbox list`::

Lists local toolbox images and containers. Note: it is typical to see two 
images listed, one with a `localhost` prefix and one with a 
`registry.fedoraproject.org` prefix. These are a normal result of the toolbox 
creation process.

`toolbox rm [--force] <name>`::

Removes one or more toolbox containers. The `--force` option removes the 
container even if it is running.

`toolbox rmi [--force] <name>`::

Removes one or more toolbox images.

`toolbox --help`::

Lists available commands.

=== Exiting a toolbox

To return to the host environment, either run `exit` or quit the current shell 
(typically Ctrl+D).
